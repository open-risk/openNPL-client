A python client for the openNPL framework. 

openNPL is an open source platform for the management of loan portfolio data with a particular focus on non-performing loans. 

openNPL implements and builds on the detailed European Banking Authority loan templates for NPL data and the US Fannie Mae / Data Dynamics schemas. It thereby enables the collection and easy management of loan data according to best-practices. 

The python client aims primarily to support extracting / loading data into openNPL, e.g., from the EBA spreadsheet files etc.
